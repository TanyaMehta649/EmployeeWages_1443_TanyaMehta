# EmployeeWages_1443_TanyaMehta
Today(4-12-2024) I have completed all the questions of the Employee Wages assignment
1. Ability to Check Employee is present or Absent- Use Math.Random to check Absent or Present.Use const which signal that the identifier  won't be reassigned. And use let where the variable may be reassigned. Both have Block  Scope. Traditional var has function scope
2. ability to calculate daily employee wage based on part time/full time. Use Math.Random to check No Time, Part Time or Full Time- Assume Part Time is 4 Hrs and Full time is 8 Hrs and per hour wage is $20- Solve Using  Switch Statement
3. refactor the code to write a function to get work hours
4. Calculating Wages for a Month assuming 20 days in a month
5.
